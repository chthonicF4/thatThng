**hello**

*contents :*

**placeholder.py** 

this is just a file that is in place of whatever script you want to run 

**Window.py** 

this is what manages the window , if you want to change anything about the window you will have to
change it here , the only things you should not touch is the Window class as well as the 
BackgroundTask class , those are for controling frame rendering and function running respectivly, if 
you mess with them they may break or behave unexpectily and that make other things break.

Run this to start it

**dependcys.py** 

running this will just make shure all required modules are installed.
good idea to run this when you first get this.

**Debug.bat**

will run with a command prompt for debuging so you can see any printed messages

**data.txt**

a file with a buch of loading statuses , just used as the file the  placholder function  can use when 
selecting a file , see placholder.py for further info
