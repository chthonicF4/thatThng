disscomboulating the combobulator
firing the orbital lazer
chopping the onions
melting the ice cubes
writing the decloration of independence 
cooking an omlet
celebrating a ducks birthday
waiting around 
puttting out fires
repaing old shoes
taking a fat dump
flushing the toilet 
selling your personal data
un-jiggling the jelly
tangling the wires
hatching a chicken from an egg
laying the bricks
shaving eyebrows
balancing pineapples on watermelons
breaking up with a fish
placing feet on table 
never gona give you up
never gona let you down
never gona run around and desert you.
never gona make you cry
never gona say good bye
never gona tell a lie and hurt you 
confessing to the pope
laminating the laminator
re-peeling the oranges
making pasta
combining corn to make megacorn
sepperating HDMI cords from the lettuce
drink caprisun
twiddling thumbs
calculating 1 / 0
baking cookies
comptimplating life
adjusting dials
wrapping up 
adding final touches 
deleting everything and starting again
